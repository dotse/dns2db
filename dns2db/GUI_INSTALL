Install and configure the Flex GUI
==================================

The GUI is provided as a precompiled binary and also in source format. The 
binary is platform-independent and will run on any Flash player with version 9 
or later. Since DNS2db is capable of using several collector servers and 
aggregate the results in the GUI. The GUI code is split in two parts, one simple
script on each collector node for accessing the databases and one set of scripts
for querying the collector nodes and presenting the Flash GUI. The naming of the
files are fairly simple. All files beginning with dns2dbnode* should be 
installed on each collector server and the rest of the files is for the 
GUI server.

The PHP files are available in the folder dns2db/www

Requirements for the GUI
========================

Collector Server

    * SQLite3 >=3.4.x
    * Apache webserver (any recent version)
    * PHP (version that supports PDO_sqlite)
    * PDO_sqlite >=1.0.1 (for PHP to use sqlite3 databases)
    * packetfiltering and secure login to the webserver to restrict access 

GUI Server

    * SQLite3 >=3.4.x
    * Apache webserver (any recent version)
    * PHP (version that supports PDO_sqlite)
    * PDO_sqlite >=1.0.1 (for PHP to use sqlite3 databases)
    * PHP cURL
    * packetfiltering and secure login to the webserver to restrict access 



Install the php-xml backend on a collector node
===============================================

Copy the files dns2dbnode.php and dns2dbnode_conf.php.example to a directory
served by the webserver on the collector node.
Copy dns2dbnode_conf.php.example to dns2dbnode_conf.php and edit the file.

You need to change the path and the beginning of filename to match parameters
configured in /etc/dns2db.conf.

Example dns2dbnode_conf.php:

// Change the DNS2db path to your db-files and the filename prefix 
(SERVER in example below).

$database = "/tmp/DNS2db/".$day."/SERVER-".$day."".$time.".db";

If all is well you should now be able to reach the xml backend on the collector
node. dns2dbnode.php does not produce xml when called without parameters. If you
would like to test the script without the GUI use this URL: (Replace the date &
time)

http://servername/dns2dbnode.php?function=topresolvers&day=20090324&time=1500&count=2

You should recieve XML output if all went well. 
This must work before we install the GUI.


Install the Flex GUI frontend
=============================

All the needed GUI files are distributed with DNS2db in the www directory.

Below commands will set up the GUI directly under the webserver document root. 
You may want to install in a separate directory eg, dns2db. Adjust accordingly.

$ cd dns2db/www
$ cp dns2db.php $DOCUMENTROOT/
$ cp dns2db_conf.php.example $DOCUMENTROOT/dns2db_conf.php
$ cp dns2db.swf $DOCUMENTROOT/
$ cp index.php $DOCUMENTROOT/
$ cp reversedb.db3 $DOCUMENTROOT/
$ chmod 755 $DOCUMENTROOT/reversedb.db3
$ chown httpd:httpd $DOCUMENTROOT/reversedb.db3  (where httpd is the user 
                                                  the webserver runs as)

In dns2db_conf.php, edit the nodelist to include the URL of the collector nodes.
(If you are not running http will need to change this as well) 
If everything is well, you should be able ro reach the GUI from:

http://SERVER/index.php

DONE!!!
