How to build and install DNS2db binaries

DEPENDENCIES
============
- libtrace-3.0.4 ( http://research.wand.net.nz/software/libtrace.php )
- ldns-1.3.0     ( http://www.nlnetlabs.nl/projects/ldns )
- sqlite-3.4.0   ( http://www.sqlite.org/ )

INSTALLATION
============

The installation basically consists of two steps, building the
binaries and creating a template database. You may also like to
install the rc start/stop script to automatically start and
stop dns2db at the appropriate run level at boot.


Build the binaries

Change to the top level directory for the system. The top level
directory should be the same as where you found this file. Then run:

   ./configure
   make
   make install

On systems where the dependent libraries are not installed in the 
default include and library search paths use the environment
variables CFLAGS and LDFLAGS to direct the compiler and linker to 
search in the correct places. For example:

   CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib" ./configure

Additional compiler and linker options can be added in the same way,
notably "-O2", "-pedantic", "-Wall", and "-std=c99" for CFLAGS.

"configure" will typically try to install the resulting binaries,
tracedns and dns2sqlite, in /usr/local/bin. If another installation
location is desired then use the appropriate command line parameters
to "configure", notably "--exec-prefix" (see "configure --help").


Create a template database

Before running dns2sqlite (directly or indirectly) you have to create
a template database for dns2sqlite to use. This template database, an
empty database with appropriate table and view definitions, is copied 
by dns2sqlite whenever it creates a new "partition". Once created the
template database does not change and may be set as read only.

To create the template database file run:

   sqlite3 <tabledefs.sql template_db_name

The "template_db_name" is later given as a command line parameter or
configuration option to dns2sqlite. The template database may be moved
or copied to any location readable by the dns2sqlite process.

If you have downloaded a tar distribution of DNS2db this template is 
supplied as "dns2db_template" in the root of the distribution. 


Optional start/stop script

A start/stop script, bin/dns2db.sh, with an associated configuration
file, , is provided. Install the script by copying the
bin/dns2db.sh script to a suitable location. The script may be used 
stand-alone to start and stop dns2db or used as an init.d/rc-script.

The basic installation is now done and after editing etc/dns2db.conf 
DNS2db can be started by:

sudo dns2db.pl 

and stopped by

sudo dns2db.pl stop

or by using the start/stop script.
