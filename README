DNS2db is no longer supported and has been replaced by the superior PacketQ. PacketQ is much faster and no longer relies on Sqlite. Go to https://github.com/dotse/packetq/ for more information. The information and source on this page is provided for historical reasons.














This is the DNS2db distribution.

Quick install:

1. Go to the dns2db subdirectory and run 

    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install 

  (see instructions in the dns2db subdirectory for further instructions)
  This will build and install the dns2sqlite and tracedns executables.
    
2. Copy the contents of the www folder to your php capable webserver 
   (mod curl is required) then copy the .example conf files and 
   edit them to fit your setup.


For complete configuration instructions follow the documentation at opensource.iis.se.
